## What is it?

Real Worl is Platform to allow users to build their own Alternate Reality Games.  

After you've built your game, Real World also hosts and runs your game.  Just start a new game, select the game you just made, then we'll give you short code that you can give to your friends.  You'll get your character info and you can get started!
